## ðŸ§  Theoretical Foundations

This codebase directly reflects the following theoretical constructs:

- **Equation 1:** Sparse Euler-Maruyama CLS update  
- **Lemma 1:** Bounded state norm under decay and bounded inputs  
- **Algorithm 1:** Sparse moduleâ†’CLS write with gating and surprise scaling  
- **Proposition 2:** Difference reward as credit assignment signal  
- **Algorithm 2:** Lyapunov exponent monitoring and learning rate scaling

See the [papers](#) for full mathematical descriptions.

## ðŸš§ Project Status

This repository is under active development.  
All code is experimental and serves as a platform for testing hypotheses proposed in the DPLD theory papers. Results will be compiled into a future **Phase 3 empirical validation paper**.
